A simple Autocomplete I'm making to practice and gain a bit of insight into data structures for strings (tries and a bit of linked lists).
This project is made with the pourpose of improving it as I keep learning about data structures in my classes.
It also works for me as practice and kind of a cheat sheet for the C++ language.
